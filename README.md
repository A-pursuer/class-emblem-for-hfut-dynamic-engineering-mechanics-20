> I am a general mechanics undergraduate who loves the CPC and loves the school. I want to make contributions to the class and school with my modest power, and also provide idears for like-minded friends. With the power of open source platform, I can realize the continuous optimization of design.



> There are a thousand Hamlets in a thousand people's eyes.  -William Shakespeare



> "You cannot come up with a plan that satifies everyone, especially in terms of design and aethetics. Therefore, what I personally propose is to integrate ideas based on you own ideas to get the best of them and get rid of the worst. It is not too much to stick to your original intention, because what you want to express is the most important thing. Everyone has their own different views, and you cannot take care of everyone's ideas." Especially in terms of design, it's great to have a scene where a hundred flowers bloom. It can provide multiple options. This is also my original intention of open source. I don't want to change the design results of many iterations due to very few ideas, so I encourage you to create a new branch or a new repo, which is a good solution Then, in the final project, you can have multiple choices, and at the same time, you have retained your perspective and adhered to your original intention, as the saying goes, "Each beauty has its own beauty, the beauty of beauty, beauty and harmony, and the world is one."



> For this project, I am busy with my studies and will not make any major changes after updating the main branch. Friends who want to contributes to this project suggest creating a new branch or a new repo (with the original source attached )If you have a good idea, welcome to put it forward in issues.



> In the end, I believe that the world will become better because of open source!

*  <span style='font-size:40px;'>&#127744;</span>**Some necessary explanations and explanations**： 
  *  `The profile` is a symmetrically divided **gear**.
  *  `The center axis` is the **“force" word fo mechanics.**
  *  `The in the inner and outer shaft walls` is **"36"**(Why use 36"工"? Ask the monitor), `~` You can abstractly understand it as holding hands.
  *  `The connecting the inner and outer shaft walls` is a spoke，which can be abstractly understood as force transfer function.
  *  `Font` use the **邓体** generated by AI. It is recommended to compare it with the font of school name.
  *  Why should I use `sunrise` as the design name? You can see <span style='font-size:30px;'>&#127774;</span>, just compare them.
  *  For details, please refer to **Design ideas of class emblem**.







<h2 align="center"> <span style='font-size:40px;'>&#128071;</span>Talking about personal design experience </h2> 



* <span style='font-size:40px;'>&#127752;</span>Design ideas：
  *  As I am not a professional, please forgive me for any inappropriate statements.
  *  Parallel architecture and deconstrution, multi version iterative optimization.
     *  architecture: Clarify the overall design idea and set the main theme and keynote.
     *  Deconstruction: Find relevant images, give them meanig, and integrate them into overall design framework.
     *  Multi Version Iterative Optimization：Replace unsatisfied related deconstruction images and reassess overall design ideas.
  *  Advantages：Can continuously introduce new ideas and ideas to continuously optimize the work.
  *  Disadvantages：If the design is not determine to meet the conditions first, the iteraction cycle is long, time-consuing, and not suitable for obsessive disorder like mine :joy:.







<h2 align="center"> <span style='font-size:40px;'>&#128071;</span>The Design ideas of class emblem </h2> 



* <span style='font-size:40px;'>&#127775;</span>**Overall design idea**：

  * <span style='font-size:30px;'>&#128293;</span>"Breaking up the whole into parts, substituting movement for stillness, endless growth, and unity between nature and man"

  * <span style='font-size:30px;'>&#128293;</span>"Driven by force, all forces are driven together, starting from cycle to cycle, generating endless vitality"

  * <span style='font-size:30px;'>&#128293;</span>"The red color inherits the blood, the revolutionary spirit endures forever, and the main theme is unswervingly united with the Party"

  * <span style='font-size:30px;'>&#128293;</span>"Love and honor the school, Deng's inscription: never forget your original intention, bear in mind your mission, work hard, and forge ahead bravely"

    *  <span style='font-size:25px;'>&#128073;</span>Breaking up the whole into parts: In the previous design version, the overall structure of emblem was a closed geometric figure, and the shape was divided into four small parts using the gear design idea. Why should we divide the gear into four small parts? Look at the fourth point, and then look at the following figure.

      *  When you run the above HTML code, you will grasp my ideas.

    * <span style='font-size:25px;'>&#128073;</span>Dynamic instead of static: The overall design adopts dynamic aesthetic design, which is unique compared to traditional static badges. Features: spokes, gears, and shafts.

    * <span style='font-size:25px;'>&#128073;</span>"Youth abounds in vitality. When encountering deep forests, they can carve out flat ground, when encountering wilderness, they can plant trees, when encountering desert, they can dig wells and springs."  -Lu Xun. The center is driven by force, and there is no end to life.

    * <span style='font-size:25px;'>&#128073;</span>Unity of Nature and Man: "The Tao generates one, one generates two, two generates three, and three generates all things."  -The Tao Te Ching.  Taking everything as a dividing unit, it adopts a symmetrical structural design.

* <span style='font-size:40px;'>&#128142;</span>**Element composition architecture**：
  *  <span style='font-size:30px;'>&#128165;</span>Main color：`Red` is the unfading sincerity in the blood. The red color inherits the blood, the revolutionary spirit endures forever, and the main theme is unswervingly united with the Party.
  *  <span style='font-size:30px;'>&#128165;</span>Font：Adopt `Deng' front`-Comrade Deng Xiaoping nominated the font of the name of Hefei University of Technology.
  *  <span style='font-size:30px;'>&#128165;</span>Gear：
     *  Unity: The key to the smooth operation of a machine lies in its gears. Each gear is concave and convex, which can complement each other during operation, thereby generating power. If each gear is smooth and perfect, the machine cannot operate because the gears do not contain each other.
     *  Collaboration spirit: Cooperate closely with each other to complement other's strengths. The closer the bite between the pitches, the faster and lighter the operation speed. Purse a development path that belongs to one's own between the smooth plane and the right angle.
     *  Industry: Symbolizes the working class. It symbolizes an essential part of the overall concept, the operating system of a machine, a country , and a society. While unknow, it plays a role of power transmission and support, so it symbolizes the construction of the system, as opposed to a cluster of scattered sand.
  *  <span style='font-size:30px;'>&#128165;</span>bearing：
     *  Coposed of 36 spokes, it symbolizes the class and works together to build an excellent class.
     *  工：A day of hfuter, a lifetime of hfuter.
        *  Engineering mechanics person，the love for hfut，the ambition of industry to serve the country
     *  力：Driving Force - The power of unity, unity is power. 
        *  Four basic forces: gravity, electromagnetic force, strong interaction, and weak interaction. There is also a universal attraction between people. The class members come from all over the world, and there is a force in the dark that brings everyone together.
        *  The intention to use fluids and solids echoes professional characteristics.

<h2 align="center"> <span style='font-size:40px;'>&#127801;</span>Summary </h2> 



> The design of Sunrise took a total of 373 days at 3:54 and was officially concluded at 21:07 on February 17, 2022.



> ![record](http://pictures.apursuer.top/pictures/202303181750858.jpg)



> * Mood：~~Relaxing，I will no longer design class emblem.~~
> * Feelings：It‘s too tired to write README:weary: , If you think this project is no so bad , you can give me a little star<span style='font-size:20px;'>&#11088;</span> in the upper right corner of the page. It will be better that you can fork this repo, This is the greatest affirmation for me:thumbsup:.
> * Thank you: I hereby thank my alma mater [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/%E5%90%88%E8%82%A5%E5%B7%A5%E4%B8%9A%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6-%40hfut-blue?style=flat-square)](http://www.hfut.edu.cn/) for bringing me up and advertising  [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/%E5%B7%A5%E7%A8%8B%E5%8A%9B%E5%AD%A6%E7%B3%BB-%40hfut-orange/style=plastic)](http://em.hfut.edu.cn/). The teachers' rich teaching experience and professional knowledge have made us feel warm and inspired during our learning process, and have filled us with confidence and motivation to continue to study and explore more fields of knowledge in the future.
> * Outlook: The original intention of the class emblem design is that the class really needs a class emblem to provide cohesion to the class. However, due to poor personal skills, I have been unable to deliver satisfactory answers. Now that the design has been completed, I do not care whether it will be adopted or not. I just look back and see how much I have really grown along the way. I think this is enough. Also with the beautiful meaning of the class emblem, the students in the class unite to build an excellent class collective, establish the ambition of industrial packaging, inherit the red faith, form a joint force to move forward, just like the newborn sun, full of vitality and constantly glowing heat. I wish every student in the class a bright future, and we all have a bright future.
